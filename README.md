### Demo
You can play Streakin [here](https://doubledherin.github.io/streakin/). Note that the game works on *desktop only*. It's somewhat responsive but you won't have the necessary controls on mobile.

### Why

A friend and I were joking about streaking, and how it really peaked as a phenomenon in the 70s. She said there should be a video game about streaking and said I should create it. My initial response was "Ah, no, video games are hard, I don't know anything about graphics ..." but then I remembered/realized that I was in the middle of a [course](https://www.kadenze.com/courses/the-nature-of-code/info) on how to code up physics engines and steering behaviors using p5.js ... and I could probably throw something together pretty quickly actually.

So that's what this is. A joke game that I built as a present for that friend.

### What
Just a static site with [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) (including the [p5 sound](https://p5js.org/reference/#/libraries/p5.sound) library).
